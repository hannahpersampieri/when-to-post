# when_to_post üëçüíÅüì±
When to Post is a chrome extension that allows the user to determine the optimal time to post to Facebook, based on when the most friends are online.

####Why is this important?
A lot of my friends claim that there is a "best time" to post on social media in order to achieve the most likes (Personally, I think it really depends on the content, but there is some truth to the statement- I don't think many of my friends are online at 4 am). I developed this chrome extension to not only put my friends' claims to the test, but because I think there are more applications than just getting a lot of attention on your new profile picture. Anything with the goal of reaching the largest target audience possible- advertising a new product, drawing attention to one's latest blog post, etc.- could benefit from this extension.

###Version 1.0
_Note: still a work in progress. Some front-end work has been done, now beginning to focus on the back-end, then will finalize the front end._
This version will only look at the activity of the Facebook chat feature- admittedly, there are flaws to this, as many users may have Facebook open in a tab that isn't being used. In future versions, I hope to work on the acitivity feed, and also look at other apps such as Instagram.
